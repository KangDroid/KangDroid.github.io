# What's this?
## INTRO
Hello! My (nick)name is KangDroid, and eng name is 'Jason HW Kang' from Republic of Korea. Right now, I'm studying SW Development in university, and especially, loves code - coding;

## Before going inside the 'body'
Well, its been a while I used English for writing; approximately 3 years from now(tmi, but still please understand for poor English.).

## Let's get inside the body!
Firstly, This blog will be maintained un-regularly, whenever I got time for writing posts. So I hope anyone bothering me to write posts, etc.

## So, actually, what is this blog about?
Basically this blog will post about my coding life and other social life. Nothing really special, but its more likely to improve my English skills and organizing coding-knowledge.

## Lastly
**"Being one of the programmer in the world? Nyah"**
**Thinking of 'What is program" and why 'programming'.** That's me.
