## What Happened?
Basically today, I went some kind of university-orientation to get some information of school clubs, and how to request facility, subjects, etc. <br/>
So I departed from home like 7:10 at the morning, and still, im at the train way - back - home. I bet I arrive at home like 11:30PM. Well, time doesn't really matter to me. I could just program some simple questions and write logs, but the thing is, im really freaking tired - sleepy though. <br/>
SO, there won't be any code log for 15th, Feb, 2019.
